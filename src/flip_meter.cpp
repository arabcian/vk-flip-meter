// ============================================================================
// FLM — Vulkan Flip Meter / Frame Pacing Layer  (v2.6 — "observability")
//
// DESIGN SUMMARY
// --------------
// Two independent paths:
//
//   1) LIMITER  — does NOT require presentWait. Pure local-clock
//      absolute-timeline FPS cap at QueuePresent (libstrangle logic). Always
//      active, shows as an instant flat line in MangoHud. Visible, safe,
//      deterministic. Requires FLM_TARGET_FPS.
//
//   2) PACER    — requires presentWait. Measurement thread reads real flip
//      timestamps and builds a timeline estimate; if an MFG (frame-gen)
//      multiplier is detected, generated frames are distributed EVENLY across
//      the flip interval (slot pacing). For smooth frametimes on a VRR panel.
//
// ANTI-STUTTER RULES (fixes for v1 placebo/stutter causes):
//   * SINGLE GATE: pacing only at ONE point (default: Present). v1 stalled at
//     both Acquire and Present → double latency.
//   * GPU-BOUND GUARD: stalling on the CPU when the game is GPU-limited drains
//     the queue and makes things worse. Pacing disables automatically when
//     consecutive frames exceed the target.
//   * FIFO/vsync BYPASS: FIFO is already locked to vsync; pacing on top fights
//     the compositor. Only MAILBOX/IMMEDIATE (VRR) is paced. Small auxiliary
//     swapchains are never paced.
//   * SOFT SLEW: timeline drift is corrected gradually instead of hard-rebasing.
//   * LEAD-BASED PRESENT: present is submitted FLM_PRESENT_LEAD_NS before the
//     predicted flip (v1's wrong "+1 frame" formula removed).
//
// Permanent fixes (from v1):
//   [FIX-1]  Hot-path shared_ptr copy (UAF).
//   [FIX-2]  DestroyDevice stops+joins all state.
//   [FIX-13] Loader chain restore on CreateDevice fallback (MangoHud crash).
//   [FIX-14] Features already in pNext are not re-injected.
//   [FIX-15] App's own presentIds are tracked (DXVK compatibility).
//
// v2.1 fixes (performance / latency / smoothness):
//   [FIX-16] SLOT INTERVAL = sliding mean of ALL intervals. m frames take T
//            total → average interval = T/m; correct slot width in both paced
//            and unpaced modes. v2 used a fake-filtered EMA (≈T) → in MFG the
//            pacer DIVIDED FPS by m. Removed.
//   [FIX-17] MFG autodetect: threshold now relative to slot-EMA
//            (interval < 0.7*ema). v2's accept-median threshold was
//            mathematically never triggered (p≈0 → mhat=1). Detection is
//            FROZEN while the gate is active (paced uniform intervals poison
//            detection → oscillation guard).
//   [FIX-18] GPU-bound guard only when FLM_TARGET_FPS>0, and uses slot-EMA
//            rather than raw intervals. In v2 MFG's bimodal intervals
//            immediately triggered the guard and killed pacing. At fps=0 the
//            target is derived from measurements anyway, so the guard is
//            meaningless there.
//   [FIX-19] "interval > 2.5*avg → is_fake" branch removed: large HITCHes
//            were classified as fake and escaped hitch detection → pacing
//            continued during a hitch (visible stutter).
//   [FIX-20] Gate wait cap is now interval-relative (max(20ms, 1.5*iv)).
//            The fixed 20ms cap made the limiter a complete NO-OP at FPS<=50.
//   [FIX-21] Live config is REAL: FLM_CONFIG=<file> (KEY=VALUE) + SIGUSR1.
//            v2 read getenv in the handler — the running process's environment
//            can't be changed externally (no-op) and getenv is not
//            async-signal-safe (UB). Handler now only sets an atomic flag;
//            reload happens in the measurement/present thread context.
//   [FIX-22] vkAcquireNextImage2KHR is now intercepted (engines using this
//            path never advanced the warmup counter → gate never opened).
//   [FIX-23] Dead state cleanup (gate_target_ns / base_flip_ns).
//
// v2.2 fixes (distilled from three independent code reviews):
//   [FIX-24] PACER lead clamp: when lead >= iv/2 the target fell into the past
//            and the gate silently became a no-op (e.g. high FPS + default
//            1ms lead). Now lead = min(FLM_PRESENT_LEAD_NS, iv/2).
//   [FIX-25] Leading whitespace in config file values was not trimmed:
//            "FLM_MODE= present" could not be parsed (string comparison).
//   [FIX-26] Reload no longer calls getenv: env is snapshotted once at init
//            (POSIX getenv has a theoretical data race in reload threads, and
//            the running process's env can't change externally anyway). Same
//            semantics: snapshot + file, file wins; if a line is removed the
//            env value is restored.
//   [FIX-27] Dead state cleanup: timeline_target_ns, app_owns_present_id,
//            filtered_interval_ns EMA (only read in di_count==0 fallback —
//            never updated at that point = constant). stat_fake →
//            stat_fake_hitch (was accumulating both fake and hitch, misleading
//            name).
//   [FIX-28] Hot-path false sharing: limiter_next_ns (present thread) and
//            fields written every frame by the measurement thread shared a
//            cache line. Separated with alignas(64).
//   [FIX-29] Log: fflush only at INFO+. DEBUG is fully buffered (64 KB) —
//            per-frame flush overhead eliminated while DEBUG is on. Note: on
//            crash the last DEBUG lines may remain in the buffer (flushed on
//            normal exit).
//   [FIX-30] CSV: 1 MB stdio buffer + no fflush in csv_flush → csv_flush is
//            now pure in-memory formatting; disk write() only when the buffer
//            fills (~26k rows). Measurement thread timing is protected from I/O.
//   [FIX-31] CSV telemetry columns: eff_mfg, slot_mean_ns, pacing —
//            for regression analysis of MFG detection and GPU-bound guard.
//   [FIX-32] FLM_STATS_INTERVAL=<sec> (hot-reloadable, default 5).
//   [FIX-33] FLM_TARGET_FPS [0,1000] clamp (atoi overflow / iv=0 guard) and
//            initial reserve() on maps.
//
// v2.3 fixes (smoothness + input lag):
//   [FIX-37] FLOOR-PACING FREEZE/BRAKE LOOP. real_win was fed only NON-FAKE
//            intervals; with floor active and m>1 ALL intervals (uniform ≈T/m
//            and the real frame's remainder) fall BELOW the fake threshold
//            (≈0.75T) → real_win + accept-median fully FREEZE → slot_iv locks
//            on the old T₀. On VRR, when FPS rises the floor becomes stale and
//            brakes every present; braked intervals also stay in the fake class
//            so the estimate can never self-correct (positive lock) — the
//            "absolute grid brake" that FIX-36 tried to eliminate came back
//            permanently. FIX: T estimation is now fake-filter-independent and
//            phase-insensitive via CYCLE SUM: the sum of the last m RAW
//            intervals ≈ T (in paced/unpaced/bimodal cases alike; ε+(T-ε)=T).
//            Updated every flip → tracks FPS changes without braking; if a
//            brake forms, negative feedback releases it. Fake class kept for
//            stats/CSV only. display_intervals median (its sole consumer)
//            removed; hitch threshold and fake split now tied to this live T
//            estimate (hitches that escaped with the stale median).
//   [FIX-38] FIX-36 false-sharing regression: real_win/real_idx/real_count
//            had been placed on the present-thread cache line (next to
//            limiter_next_ns) but the MEASUREMENT thread writes them every
//            frame → the cache-line ping-pong fixed by FIX-28 came back.
//            Moved to the measurement block; only present-thread fields remain
//            on the present line.
//   [FIX-39] ADAPTIVE SPIN: the kernel sleep's actual wakeup latency
//            (oversleep) is tracked with a damped maximum; spin margin is
//            adjusted accordingly. On a loaded system the fixed 150 µs margin
//            caused the gate to MISS its target (floor missed → jitter spike);
//            on a quiescent/RT system it burned ~120 µs of pointless spin every
//            frame (≈3% of core time at 240 FPS). FLM_SPIN_ADAPT=0 → old fixed
//            behaviour; FLM_SPIN_NS=0 → pure sleep (unchanged).
//   [FIX-40] Low-FPS warmup lock: hitch threshold starts at the 16.6 ms
//            default, so at ~30 FPS the FIRST frames are classified as hitches
//            and the estimation window never warms up, leaving pacing
//            permanently disabled. Hitch classification is suppressed until the
//            window is warm (4 samples).
//
// v2.4 fixes (smoothness — concept-validation review):
//   [FIX-42] With fps>0 the floor path was BYPASSING the LIMITER: the floor
//            branch only checked !limiter_mode. AUTO + presentWait +
//            FLM_TARGET_FPS=120 → slot=8.33ms, floor=7.08ms → game could run
//            up to 117% of the target (≈141 FPS); no hard lock → wavy
//            frametime. Floor is now ONLY for fps==0 (natural cadence); at
//            fps>0 the classic lead-based timeline pacer is used (full lock).
//            Consistent with the README.
//   [FIX-43] MEASUREMENT FRESHNESS GUARD. If presentWait measurement never
//            produces samples (game sends id=0 → continuous TIMEOUT)
//            slot_interval_ns stays at the 16.6ms default → floor≈14.2ms →
//            a 240Hz game gets CAPPED at ~70 FPS. Same class of problem after
//            alt-tab / OUT_OF_DATE. Measurement thread publishes last_flip_ns
//            on every successful flip; pacer and floor gates (NOT the limiter)
//            shut themselves off and reset anchors if there are no samples or
//            the last flip is older than MEAS_FRESH_NS (250ms). No measurement
//            flow → no pacing.
//   [FIX-44] FLOOR RATIO AUTOTUNE (closed loop). At ratio=850, m=2 the
//            steady-state intervals ALTERNATE 0.425T / 0.575T (CoV ≈15%) —
//            the structural cause of "better but not quite smooth". The ideal
//            ratio is usually close to 1000 but a fixed high ratio brakes
//            early-arriving real frames. Fix: if recent presents have abundant
//            headroom (since-floor), ratio is tightened SLOWLY (+1/frame); if
//            headroom narrows or consecutive >= max(2,m) presents are held
//            (brake sign), it is QUICKLY loosened. Delta [-150,+150] stacks on
//            top of the base ratio and MFG-adapt; [500,1000] clamp preserved.
//            FLM_FLOOR_AUTOTUNE=0 → old fixed-ratio behaviour.
//   [FIX-45] Cleanup: dead cap in floor path (left < floor*2 — since>=0 means
//            left<=floor, cap was never reachable) simplified; hitch and
//            GPU-bound branches now explicitly reset the floor anchor
//            (last_present_ns) and autotune brake counter (explicit re-anchor
//            instead of implicit).
//
// v2.5 fixes (steady-state robustness + hot-path cost):
//   [FIX-46] ADAPTIVE SPIN OUTLIER STICKINESS. The damped maximum
//            (est = max(os, est - est/256)) let a single 2ms oversleep (page
//            fault / P-state / SMI) pin the spin margin near ~3ms for ≈256
//            samples — >1s of ~3ms-per-frame spinning at 240 FPS, burning
//            ≈70% of a core and feeding boost-clock backpressure into
//            frametime. Estimator replaced with a 16-sample ring + p75
//            (isolated spikes cannot move it; genuine load converges in 4-5
//            samples); margin cap lowered 2ms → 500µs.
//   [FIX-47] MFG DETECTION FREEZE/HOT-GATE DEADLOCK. Floor pacing holds ≥1
//            present per cycle at m>1 → gate_hot never cooled → the FIX-17
//            detection freeze became PERMANENT: an in-game multiplier change
//            (2→3, or MFG off) was never picked up; 3x content ran with a 2x
//            distribution forever. Every 10s the gate now stands down for 24
//            flips (invisible on VRR) and m is re-measured from the raw
//            stream (probe). m→1 was already self-correcting via cycle sums;
//            this closes the upward path.
//   [FIX-48] MFG detect window 64 → 32: halves the mixed-sample transient
//            real_win ingests during a multiplier transition (~0.3-0.5s →
//            ~0.15-0.25s); p=(m-1)/m is still cleanly resolved at 32 samples.
//   [FIX-49] present_seq incremented only inside the gate condition → with
//            FLM_PACE_POINT=acquire the CSV slot column froze at 0. Telemetry
//            decoupled from gating; every primary-swapchain present counts.
//   [FIX-50] Hot-path cost: (a) thread_local generation-validated swapchain
//            state cache — shared_mutex + hash + shared_ptr copy no longer
//            paid twice per frame; (b) single now_ns() per gate entry (was up
//            to 3 on the floor path); (c) real_win median cached and
//            recomputed once per PUSH instead of copy+sort twice per flip.
//   [FIX-51] Cache-line layout: atomics regrouped BY WRITER THREAD (present-
//            written line + measurement-written line) instead of one line per
//            atomic — same writer-isolation guarantee, 9 lines → 2.
//   [FIX-52] resolve_gate PRESENT/AUTO byte-identical branches merged; CMake/
//            manifest version now generated from one place (configure_file),
//            build.sh sed patching removed.
//   [FIX-53] FLM_PACE_FIFO=1: opt-in to allow PACER (and floor-pacing) on
//            FIFO/FIFO_RELAXED swapchains. Previously resolve_gate excluded
//            FIFO unconditionally with no override — the only path was
//            LIMITER. Default stays off (0): FIFO is already vsync-locked,
//            layering PACER on top can fight the compositor's own pacing on
//            most content. For engines that only expose FIFO but still
//            benefit from PACER/floor smoothing (e.g. MFG), the filter can
//            now be lifted explicitly.
//   [FIX-56] FLOOR_MFG_ADAPT was relaxing floor_ratio LINEARLY in (m-1), on
//            the assumption that each extra generated frame adds a fixed
//            variance increment. Same-scene A/B data (identical GPU load)
//            showed 4x producing a 5.50% hitch rate against 2x's 0.02% — a
//            ~275x gap a linear step cannot explain. The three interpolated
//            frames in 4x share optical-flow cost variance from the same
//            motion-vector pass, so the needed slack grows faster than
//            linearly. Ratio relax now scales with (m-1)*m/2 (1/3/6 at
//            m=2/3/4) instead of (m-1) (1/2/3); the autotune brake's loosen
//            step (on consecutive held real frames) scales with (m-1)
//            instead of a fixed -4, so it clears a high-m backlog in one
//            correction instead of several cycles of repeated hitching.
//
// v2.6 fixes (observability + robustness — full-code architectural review):
//   [FIX-57] CSV PATH REGISTRY. Every SwapchainState fopen'd FLM_CSV with
//            "w" → every swapchain RECREATION (resolution change, fullscreen
//            toggle, alt-tab OUT_OF_DATE loop) silently TRUNCATED the CSV
//            mid-session, destroying the A/B run being recorded. First open
//            per path truncates + writes the header; re-opens append with no
//            header (one continuous file across recreations); a concurrent
//            second swapchain on the same path gets "<path>.2" instead of
//            interleaving torn rows into one stream.
//   [FIX-58] STATS now answers the tuning question directly: fake and hitch
//            counted SEPARATELY (FIX-27's combined counter hid a 5.50%
//            hitch-rate regression behind m=4's dominant fake count), and a
//            p99 over all presented intervals in the window is reported —
//            the live equivalent of the offline CSV percentile workflow.
//            Ring capped at 4096 samples/window; nth_element once per window.
//   [FIX-59] FLM_MEASURE_CPU accepts comma lists of ranges/cores
//            ("0-3,8,10-11"). The documented list form was a silent parse
//            error; non-contiguous pin sets (CCD minus SMT siblings) were
//            inexpressible.
//   [FIX-60] SIGUSR1 reload log prints the full effective floor/pacing state
//            (ratio, adapt, autotune, pace_fifo, ...) so a live retune is
//            verifiable at INFO level — typo'd keys are silently ignored by
//            apply_dynamic_kv, and the old 4-field line couldn't confirm the
//            floor knobs landed.
//   [FIX-61] FLM_LIB_PATH in CMakeLists now overridable via -D (CACHE STRING).
//            A plain set() always wins over -D args; the old form silently
//            ignored Portage get_libdir, writing the wrong path into the
//            installed manifest on multilib Gentoo.

//  FLM_MODE=auto|present|limiter|off   (default: auto)
//     auto     : PACER if presentWait available, else LIMITER if fps is set
//     present  : force PACER (falls back to limiter if no presentWait)
//     limiter  : pure FPS limiter (no presentWait needed, requires FLM_TARGET_FPS)
//     off      : do nothing (A/B test baseline)
//  FLM_TARGET_FPS=<n>          limiter/pacer target fps (0 = natural cadence)
//  FLM_PACE_POINT=present|acquire|both  (default: present) — SINGLE gate point
//  FLM_PACE_FIFO=1             [FIX-53] allow PACER/floor-pacing on FIFO too
//                              (default 0). FIFO is already vsync-locked;

//                              smoothing on top of it (e.g. FIFO-only MFG
//                              engine). LIMITER is unaffected either way.
//  FLM_FLOOR_PACING=1          [FIX-36] VRR+MFG floor-pacing (default 1/on).
//                              Active on the fps=0 (natural cadence) + pacer
//                              path. Relative floor instead of absolute grid:
//                              present exits at least floor after the previous.
//                              Equalises Ada (40-series, no HW flip metering)
//                              MFG's ε-interval generated frames, does not brake
//                              real frames, does not distort variable FPS.

//                              Main hand-tuning knob. Low (700) = loose, jitter

//                              flatter but risks hitch if late.
//                              LIVE: write to FLM_CONFIG file + kill -USR1 <pid>.
//  FLM_FLOOR_MFG_ADAPT=1       [FIX-41][FIX-56] relax FLOOR_RATIO as m (MFG

//                              variance grows; a fixed tight ratio may hold real
//                              frames unnecessarily, raising hitch% and cov%.

//                              stacks on base ratio and MFG-adapt. 0 = fixed ratio.

//  QUICK VERIFICATION:
